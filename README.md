## 📌 Project Overview

FinSight Rapid allows users to input:

* Monthly Revenue
* Monthly Expenses
* Existing Debt
* Business Goal (Loan Application, Expansion, Cash Flow Optimization)

Based on these inputs, the system calculates:

* Net Profit
* Debt Ratio
* Business Health Status
* Cash Flow Risk
* Debt Risk Assessment
* Structured Financial Recommendations

The application demonstrates AI-style reasoning using financial logic rules implemented in JavaScript.

## 🧠 Core Financial Logic

The system computes:

Net Profit = Revenue − Expenses
Debt Ratio = Debt ÷ Revenue

### Decision Rules:

* Net Profit ≤ 0 → Business Health: Critical
* Net Profit > 0 and Debt Ratio > 0.5 → High Risk
* Net Profit > 0 and Debt Ratio ≤ 0.5 → Stable

Results are presented in structured, professional financial language.
